## 📌 Recruiter Note
This project was intentionally designed as a **professional showcase** rather than a hobby app.  
It highlights my ability to:

- Build attractive, responsive UIs with clear hierarchy and polished design.  
- Apply **UI/UX principles** to create recruiter‑friendly layouts and user flows.  
- Integrate visible **cybersecurity features** such as input sanitization, lock icons, and security badges.  
- Implement and troubleshoot **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions to automate builds, linting, testing, and security checks.  
- Present technical work in a way that demonstrates both **front‑end mastery** and **awareness of modern DevOps practices**.  

⚡ This repo is a **demo of an AI‑inspired automation workflow** — showing how modern apps can combine **UI/UX clarity, security awareness, and automated pipelines** to deliver recruiter‑ready results.
